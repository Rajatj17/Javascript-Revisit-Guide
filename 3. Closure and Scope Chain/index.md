Perfect! Let's dive into **Module 3: Closures & Scope Chain**.There's **Module 3: Closures & Scope Chain** in comprehensive detail!

This module covers:
- **What closures actually are** - function + lexical environment preservation
- **How scope chain resolution works** - building on Module 1's lexical environments  
- **Essential closure patterns** - data privacy, function factories, modules, currying
- **Common gotchas** - loop closure problem, memory leaks, `this` binding issues
- **Advanced concepts** - performance considerations, async operations, debugging
- **Real-world applications** - event handlers, API clients, memoization
- **Practical challenges** - rate limiters, caches, secret keepers

The key insight is that closures aren't just "inner functions" - they're the mechanism that preserves lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This enables powerful patterns like data privacy and function factories.

Pay special attention to:
- The loop closure problem (appears in almost every interview)
- How closures can accidentally cause memory leaks
- Using closures for data privacy and module patterns
- The difference between closure scope and `this` binding

The practice challenges are designed to test real-world closure usage. The secret keeper and event emitter challenges especially test your understanding of private state through closures.

When you're comfortable with:
- Explaining how closures preserve scope
- Solving the loop closure problem multiple ways
- Using closures for data privacy patterns
- Understanding memory implications
- Debugging scope chain issues
