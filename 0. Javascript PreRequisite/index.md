# JavaScript Interview Prep: Prerequisites & Reading Order

## üéØ Essential Prerequisites (Read These First!)

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript Concepts

  - Compilation vs Interpretation
  - V8 engine basics (Chrome/Node.js)
  - Call stack fundamentals

#### Lexical Environment (CRITICAL!)
```javascript
// You need to understand this concept deeply
function outer() {
    var outerVar = "I'm outer";
    
    function inner() {
        var innerVar = "I'm inner";
        console.log(outerVar); // How does this work?
    }
    
    return inner;
}

// What happens here?
var myFunc = outer();
myFunc(); // How does inner() still access outerVar?
```

**Key concepts to understand:**
- Environment Record (where variables are stored)
- Outer Environment Reference (the scope chain)
- How environments are created and linked

#### Memory Management Basics
- **Stack vs Heap**
  - Primitives in stack

## üéØ Red Flags (Don't Skip These!)

**If you don't understand these, stop and learn them first:**

‚ùå **"I don't know what lexical environment means"**
‚ùå **"I'm confused about scope vs context"**  
‚ùå **"I don't understand how closures work"**
‚ùå **"I can't explain what 'this' refers to"**
‚ùå **"I don't know the difference between prototype and __proto__"**
‚ùå **"I'm unclear about the event loop"**

These concepts are fundamental to everything else!

The key is building a solid foundation. Rushing into advanced topics without understanding the basics will make everything much harder. Take time with the prerequisites - it's an investment that pays off massively!
